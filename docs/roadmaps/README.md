# Roadmaps

Status: reference
Updated: 2026-09-10

Northstar roadmaps use one generation-plus-task model:

- the active generation README owns the roadmap and approved frontier;
- `gNN/NNN-<slug>.md` is the sole executable planning unit;
- that unit is a **Northstar task**, referenced as `gNN.NNN`;
- no milestone wrapper, nested `batch-cards/`, or dual task authority is supported.

## Current state

- [`generation-index.md`](generation-index.md) names the active generation.
- [`g18/README.md`](g18/README.md) is the current roadmap and approved frontier.
- [`dispatch.md`](dispatch.md) is only the queue transport projection.
- [`archive/`](archive/) contains compact non-procedural roll-ups for g01–g17.
- [`../evidence/nucleus/`](../evidence/nucleus/) holds the current Nucleus
  cohort, M1/A1 receipts, schemas, and generated ledger.

`g18.002` merged in PR #236 on 2026-09-10 after independent exact-head
review. It delivered the paired Svelte and React CodeEditor over CodeMirror 6
and the accepted `Tabs.pinned` contract. GPUI CodeEditor parity is a future
planning horizon and the g18 GPUI repair runway remains open. Return to
Chatterbox for release/adoption authority.

## Rules

- Keep task work bounded by current architecture, contracts, and accepted intent.
- Each ready task carries its own scope, ordered work, dependencies, dispatch
  boundary, acceptance oracle, validation, evidence, ownership, and stop gates.
- Use [`templates/task-template.md`](templates/task-template.md) for new tasks.
- A queue task is a control-plane record, not planning authority. An Effigy task
  is a command selector, not a Northstar task.
- Unresolved or deferred candidates live in [`../triage/`](../triage/) until
  promoted; triage notes carry no execution authority. Architecture lives in
  `../architecture/`.
- Generation rollover is manual. Close, pause, supersede, or rehome every live
  task before opening the next generation.
- Completed generations compact to `archive/gNN.md`; git preserves detail.

## Reading order

Start with `generation-index.md`, then the active generation README, then the
ready task. Historical work should not be needed to execute current work.
