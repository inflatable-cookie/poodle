## Generation outcome

Turn the 175-component portable GPUI surface from construction coverage into
contract-bound functional evidence, repair real gaps in bounded tranches, and
make it impossible to call a component complete from a specimen route or test
name alone.

This generation does not revive the rejected g14 conformance corpus. Component
contracts remain semantic authority; mounted runtime evidence proves only the
capabilities it actually drives.

## Current state

- 176 public components; 175 portable native targets; MeterSurface is the one
  contract-approved web-only row.
- 175/175 GPUI specimen routes construct headlessly.
- 29/175 components have validated mounted-behaviour receipts through the
  Nucleus cohort; 146 remain missing in the current ledger.
- Of those 146, 44 have retained named mounted-test expectations but no
  validated execution receipt. The other 102 have no admitted mounted receipt
  or retained expected-test entry.
- GPUI visual evidence covers the 29-row Nucleus cohort; 146 rows remain
  missing. Broad platform accessibility proof remains held separately.
- g18.001 census (PR #235): 73/175 portable rows carry at least one admitted mounted capability, 24/175 fully admitted; 224 refusals and 11 substrate groups await tranche compilation.

Construction is not functional completion. A bounded regression is not whole-
contract proof. The first task establishes the capability-level denominator
needed to compile honest repair tranches.

## Generation runway

| Task or planning horizon | State | Dependency or checkpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`g18.001`](001-contract-bound-gpui-functionality-census.md) — contract-bound GPUI functionality census | complete | PR #235 (merge `8185a9758f146e901499a8a8704a41202f99ca9e`) |
| [`g18.002`](002-codemirror-web-code-editor.md) — CodeMirror web CodeEditor | ready, dispatch held | separate operator go; bounded consumer interrupt |
| First functional repair tranche | planning horizon | compile from accepted g18.001 missing-capability output |
| Remaining mounted behaviour tranches | planning horizon | bounded by dependency and interaction substrate, not arbitrary component count |
| GPUI visual expansion | planning horizon | functional tranche stable; operator-approved background-safe capture |
| GPUI keyboard-origin focus | planning horizon | census identifies affected focus-bearing rows |
| A2 platform accessibility | held | `gpui-apple` publishes a buildable crate and live non-activating tree proof is available |
| Nucleus V2/M2/switch packet | external horizon | Nucleus-owned seeding and journeys plus Lab V2 and A2 |

## Approved frontier

`g18.002` is the sole approved ready task. Queue dispatch still requires a
separate operator go. It is a bounded consumer interrupt: deliver the paired
Svelte and React CodeEditor over CodeMirror 6, plus `Tabs.pinned` across the
normal active cohort. It does not admit a GPUI CodeEditor, authorize release or
Desktop adoption, or replace the pending GPUI repair-tranche compilation.

## Held and recurring work

- Web-pair composite extraction remains an operator checkpoint when a shared
  composite is next touched or a second React consumer arrives.
- Contributor design-guidance pilot remains operator-gated on named reviewers,
  approvals, and run custody.
- Jetstream admission remains a separate held programme.
- GPUI and shared-Rust CodeEditor work is a future planning horizon. The web
  admission earns no native parity credit.
- Citations, nested menus, keyboard geometry, consumer requests, repository
  settings, and `gpui-unofficial` adoption gates remain in current triage.

## Completion rule

g18 completes only when every portable row has capability-level disposition:
validated mounted proof, a repaired and proved implementation, or a current
contract/platform hold with a named owner and recheck. Aggregate construction
counts and source presence cannot satisfy this rule.
