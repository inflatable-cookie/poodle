# Changelog

Notable changes to Poodle are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Poodle is pre-1.0,
so minor releases may contain documented breaking changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Prepared the repository, package documentation, licensing, security policy,
  and validation surfaces for public access.
- Completed the shared Rust render-tree migration. GPUI and Jetstream now
  interpret the same `poodle-node` output instead of maintaining duplicate
  component implementations.
- Completed the native accessibility naming audit across the Jetstream
  specimen catalogue.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Established the first documented preview baseline: framework-free core,
  Svelte and experimental React component packages, shared tokens and themes,
  Rust contracts, the shared render tree, and GPUI and Jetstream adapters.
  This was a source/version baseline, not a registry publication or GitHub
  release tag.

### Changed

- Renamed theme IDs and removed the obsolete `poodle-workstation` crate. See
  the [full 0.1.0 release notes](docs/release-notes/0.1.0.md) for package lists,
  migration guidance, and downstream checks.
